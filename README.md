# mmrisk_instrument
Code to run experiment for "Risk taking on behalf of others: Does the timing of uncertainty revelation matter?" by Alexander W. Cappelen, Erik Ø. Sørensen, Bertil Tungodden and Xiaogeng Xu.

This code runs as a Django project. The files distributed here are configured to run
as a local project with the development server. For proper production run, more infrastructure
is needed.

- A proper database. The experiment was run in the summer of 2019 with a Postgres.
- A webserver. The experiment was run in the summer of 2019 with Apache.
